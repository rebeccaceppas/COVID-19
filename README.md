# COVID-19 data visualization

## The project

A simple project to help me collect and visualize data about COVID-19 cases and deaths. 
For now, it gives me graphs on the data for Brazil, Canada and the United States, but it can be adjust code to get data for any country.
It still depends on downsloading the data from the url given at the top. Want to change that (need to find website with daily updates and scrape it)

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pyplot module from matplotlib for visualization
  - pip install matplotlib
- Pandas for data collection
  - pip install pandas

## Data 

Collected from this project: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data for now.
